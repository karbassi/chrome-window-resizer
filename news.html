				<h1>History</h1>

				
				<div class="release latest-version">
					<h3>Version 1.7.0 <span>(2011-05-14)</span>:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Added the resize options as a context menu (right-click) for pop-up windows, when the toolbar icon is not available.
						</li>
						<li>
							Added option to center window on screen when resized.
							<br />
							This can be set for each preset individually, or you can set it globally from the "Settings" page (overriding everything else).
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div class="release">
					<h3>Version 1.6.2 <span>(2011-03-31)</span>:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Minor bugs fixed.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div class="release">
					<h3>Version 1.6.1 <span>(2011-03-30)</span>:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Improved mechanism for resizing the viewport. Previously, if the window was maximized when trying to resize the viewport, there was a bug that
							caused the extension to set negative values for the width and height, and the window ended being 0 pixels wide.
						</li>
						<li>
							The extension now needs the permission to access the content on all pages. 
							This is required in order for the extension's option to resize just the viewport to work in the latest Chrome dev releases.
							<br /><br />
							<strong>Technical info:</strong>
							<br />
							In order to resize the viewport, the extension needs to know the size of the window's borders, but, unfortunetly, this isn't available through the API.
							So, in order to determine the borders' size, the extension reads the width and height of the actual window, then it takes a screenshot of the
							visible area of the current tab and it substracts the size of the generated image from the window's size.
							<br />
							Unfortunetly, the latest dev versions of Chrome require the extension to ask for permission to access the content of any given tab in order for it
							to be able to take a screenshot of that tab using the API and that's why it stopped working.
						</li>
						
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div class="release">
					<h3>Version 1.6.0 <span>(2010-10-05)</span>:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Added the option to use the current window's position.<br />
							Check "Use current window position" and move the window to the desired location on the screen 
							to update the Left/Top values.
							
							<br />
							Many thanks to <strong>Paul H.</strong> for the suggestions! ;)
						</li>
						<li>
							Added a way to export your settings so you can import them in another (Chrome) browser.
							This way, you can easily copy your settings from your home computer to your office or whatever... :)
						</li>
						<li>
							Fixed bug that was preventing to update the window's position for resolutions defined as "mobile".
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div class="release">
					<h3>Version 1.5.0 <span>(2010-10-04)</span>:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Added new option on the settings page to control the behavior of the extension's icon when clicked.<br />
							You can choose to display the default menu (the resolutions list) or to cycle through the defined resolutions.
						</li>
						<li>
							Added the option to set the window's position by specifying the X,Y coordinates (the left and top position).
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div class="release">
					<h3>Version 1.4.4 <span>(2010-09-14)</span>:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Fixed some bug with adding/editing resolutions.<br />
							When adding resolutions, the script failed to assign a unique ID and if you tried to edit any of those
							the script would assign the new values to all the new resolutions in the list.<br />
							However, the settings were saved correctly and if you closed the settings page and opened it again, the resolutions list
							would display correctly.<br />
							Thanks to <strong>Nate Jr. (n8)</strong> for taking the time to report this bug!
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div class="release">
					<h3>Version 1.4.3 <span>(2010-08-22)</span>:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Fixed issue with window size overlay appearing on printed pages.<br />
							Thanks to user <strong>juliog</strong> for reporting it and also providing a solution to the problem!
						</li>
						<li>
							The extension will try to detect if the current page is a view-source page or a media file (image, mp3, video, etc.)
							before trying to insert the window size overlay in the bottom-right corner.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>NOTE FOR WEBSITES DEVELOPERS</strong><br />
							Users <strong>Vinz</strong> and <strong>Ryan</strong> also reported an issue related not only to this extension, 
							but to all extensions (E.g.: MeasureIt) that are using extension specific content scripts (scripts that are altering the DOM 
							or adding CSS/JS to the page to perform certain functions; E.g.: overlays).<br />
							As far as I can tell, this issue appears on websites using the <code>head:first-child + body</code> CSS selector to apply certain 
							styles only on some browsers.<br />
							The problem is that Chrome (wrongly) inserts a &lt;style&gt; tag right before the &lt;head&gt; (instead of inside) to add those content scripts, 
							making the aforementioned CSS selector useless (and breaking your page if you're using it) since &lt;head&gt; is not the first-child anymore...
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div class="release">
					<h3>Version 1.4.2 <span>(2010-05-31)</span>:</h3>

					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div class="release">

							Thank you Dima for pointing it out to me!

						<li>Added a tooltip that's displayed in the bottom right corner of the page when resizing the window. (only available on pages loaded via the HTTP or HTTPS protocols; it won't work on local files, extensions settings pages, the new tab page, the Chrome extensions gallery or any other special page)</li>
						<li>
							Added new settings page, where you can control several options, like whether to display or not the tooltip when resizing, the duration the tooltip is displayed, 
							whether to display or not the resolution description in the popup and the width of the popup.
